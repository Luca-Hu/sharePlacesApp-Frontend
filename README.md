1、Introduction


This Web Application's name is sharePlacesApp.

It is a fullstack React.js application with Node.js, Express.js & MongoDB (MERN).  

It is an amazing Web application for Real Time photo sharing, which is similar to apps like Instagram in function. You can create your own account (password will be hashed) and post the pictures you want to share on your own homepage. The application also allows you to edit and delete your own images. Meanwhile, the GoogleMap API will automatically locate your typed address on the map, and anyone can view the Google Map location corresponding to each picture.

It has been deployed on Heroku, so you can access it through the link below:

3、Access to Test


It has been deployed on Heroku so you can access it through this link：

(Note: Since no cloud like AWS S3 is used to save images, all images will not be permanently saved, which is a drawback.）


You can login default user1 's account : Email: test1@test.com ， Password:tester

(Tips: All default users' initial password is "tester", you can login other default users' account: test(1~6)@test.com )
